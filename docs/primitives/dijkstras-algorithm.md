# Dijkstra's Algorithm

There's a great explanation of [Dijkstra's algorithm at Red Blob Games](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html#dijkstra).

Unlike [breadth-first search](./breadth-first-search.md), Dijkstra's algorithm takes terrain cost into account. It's the go-to for computing flow fields and distance maps.
