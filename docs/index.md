# Clockwork

A set of highly-optimized primitives for routing, pathfinding, and traffic management. Compose these pieces to create pathfinding logic tuned to specific situations.

## Theory

- [Primitives](./primitives/index.md): Data types and algorithms
- [Scenarios](./scenarios.md): Optimizing pathfinding for different kinds of situations
- [Architecture](./architecture/index.md): How the composable pieces fit together

## Development

- [WASM details](./wasm/index.md): Notes around the WASM implementation
- [Testing](./testing.md): Philosophy and details around testing and visualizations

## API Docs

- [Screeps-Clockwork](./api) API docs
